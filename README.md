# MooEye - A ggez-based UI-library

This is a very simple UI-library to be used with the [ggez game library](https://github.com/ggez/ggez). I wrote this for my own projects and as a challenge. The whole library is very much work-in-progress.

## Features

 * Static UI that communicates with each other via a message-based system.
 * Can use ggez image and text objects as UI elements.
 * Can order elements in multiple types of boxes, alignments, and dynamic sizing.
 * Caching of element positions means a recalculation of dynamic element positions is only neccessary when the window size changes or the UI elements themselves change.

 ## TODOs

 * Full implementation of message based communication.
 * Full implementation of transition system.
 * More types of containers (especially a grid based one).
 * Examples & usage guides.
 * More extensive documentation.
 * Possibly docs.rs and crates.io releaes.

 ## Maintenance

 I am maintaining this project mostly for my own purposes. You may not actually want to use this, but hey, it's public. Bug fixes are not guaranteed and features may be lacking.
